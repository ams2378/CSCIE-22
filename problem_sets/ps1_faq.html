<p><strong>Problem 1 requires us to draw a memory diagram. What
    file format should we submit this diagram in?</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, for the Part I problems 
you should submit your work in a <a href="plain_text.html">plain-text file</a>. 
Because we are asking you to draw a diagram, you may submit
<em>either</em> a plain-text file or a PDF file.</p>
<p>If you are using a PDF file, you can create the diagram using 
the tool of your choice and embed it in the PDF. If you are 
using a plain-text file, you can create the diagram using
&ldquo;ASCII art&rdquo;. Here is an example of a perfectly good
ASCII memory diagram:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    Stack:           Heap:
        ----         -----------------
    arr | -|--------&gt;| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

<p><strong>When I run one of the recursive methods that I&rsquo;ve written for
    problem 7, I get a <code>NullPointerException</code>. Do you have
    any idea of why that might be happening?</strong></p>
<p>A <code>NullPointerException</code> occurs when you try to call a method using
a reference variable with a value of <code>null</code>. For example, if you
have a variable named <code>str</code> with a value of <code>null</code> and you call
<code>str.length()</code>, you will get this exception because there is no
object on which the <code>length()</code> method can be invoked. You may need
to check first if the value of a reference variable is <code>null</code> before
attempting to use it to call a method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In one of my recursive methods for problem 7, I&rsquo;m getting a
    <code>StringIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>. What am I doing wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that the characters in a string have index values that
go from 0 to length - 1. The exception means that your code is using
an index from outside that range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In one of my recursive methods for problem 7, I&rsquo;m using the
    <code>substring</code> method to create a substring that has everything but the
    first character from the original string. I&rsquo;m using the expression
    <code>str.substring(1, str.length() - 1)</code>, but I seem to be losing
    characters at the end of the string as well.</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that the second parameter to the <code>substring</code> method is
non-inclusive. So if you want the last character to be included in
the substring, your should use the expression
<code>str.substring(1, str.length())</code> &ndash; without the &ldquo;- 1&rdquo;.
Alternatively, you could use the version of <code>substring</code> that only
takes a start index: <code>str.substring(1)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m having trouble figuring out how to structure the recursive
    case of one of the recursive methods for problem 7. Do you have any
    hints on how to do this?</strong></p>
<p>One thing that can help is to consider what should happen for one or
more concrete cases &ndash; as we did in the example problem that we
covered in lecture.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say that you needed to write a recursive
<code>removeVowels</code> method. As
with many recursive methods that operate on strings, this method
should make recursive calls on ever smaller substrings. For example,
let&rsquo;s say that we wanted to do <code>removeVowels("movies")</code></p>
<p>This would lead to the following sequence of method calls:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">removeVowels</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;movies&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="n">removeVowels</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;ovies&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
        <span class="n">removeVowels</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;vies&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
            <span class="n">removeVowels</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;ies&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
                <span class="n">removeVowels</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;es&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
                    <span class="n">removeVowels</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;s&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
                        <span class="n">removeVowels</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(The last call might not be needed. It depends on which base cases
you choose to include.)</p>
<p>Then, once you have the sequence of method calls, you should think
about what each of these separate method calls should return,
treating them as if they were independent of each other. For
example, what should <code>removeVowels("ies")</code> return &ndash; i.e., what
string will result if the vowels in <code>"ies"</code> were removed? Based on
these return values, you should be able to figure out how a given
invocation of the method should use the return value from the
recursive call to form its own return value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One of my recursive methods for problem 7 is not working
    correctly. Do you have any suggestions?</strong></p>
<p>Try tracing through some concrete examples of cases in which the
your method is not returning the correct value. You might want to
try adding some temporary printlns to see if that helps you to
diagnose the problem. In particular, you could print what the method
will return before it actually returns it. That will allow you to
see when the wrong value is being returned.</p>
<p>In addition, if your method returns a value, make sure that you
aren&rsquo;t throwing away the return value of the recursive call. For
example, consider this incorrect version of a recursive method that
determines if a string is a palindrome &ndash; i.e., if it is a word like
&ldquo;radar&rdquo; that reads the same in either direction:  </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">isPalindrome</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">str</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>  
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">str</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">null</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="n">str</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">equals</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">))</span> <span class="o">{</span>  
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">;</span>  
    <span class="o">}</span>

<p>This version of the method makes the correct recursive call &ndash;
looking at the substring consisting of everything except the first
and last characters &ndash; but it throws away the value that is
returned.</p>
<p>To avoid losing the return value of the recursive call, we can do
one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>assign it to a variable, and then do something with that
    variable</li>
<li>make the recursive call part of a return statement, if doing so
    makes sense. It may not always make sense &ndash; especially if the
    value that the current method call should return depends on the
    value that was returned by the recursive call.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m having trouble with the Lagrange problem. Can you give us any 
    hints on how to get started?</strong></p>
<p>Carefully read over the example that we&rsquo;ve given you in the
problem itself (the one in which we break up 140). It should give
you some insight about how to structure your method &ndash; including
what base case(s) you will need, and what your recursive call
should look like.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that a given call of the recursive method is responsible
for determining the value of one of the variables that you are working
with (in this case, one of the terms of the sum), and that the method
should use a loop to try all possible values for that variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I am struggling to apply the backtracking template from the
    lecture notes to the Lagrange problem. I&rsquo;m confused about what <code>n</code>
    and <code>val</code> in the template should mean in the context of this
    problem. Also, is an <code>isValid()</code> method needed here?</strong></p>
<p>The template is useful, but you shouldn&rsquo;t get too bogged down in
the details of it. Focus first on the basics of recursive
backtracking and on the example given in the problem itself. You
should see that the template fits pretty well &ndash; although your
solution may end up differing from the exact structure shown in
the template.</p>
<p>As we said in lecture, recursive backtracking is a method for
assigning values to a set of variables in light of a set of
constraints. In the template, <code>n</code> tells you the variable that you&rsquo;re
currently trying to assign a value to, and <code>val</code> iterates over the set
of possible values for that variable. (Note that <code>n</code> is not the variable
itself - it is simply a parameter that allows you to determine the
variable. For example, in the Queens problem, <code>n</code> was the number of row
in which we were trying to place a queen, but we stored the actual
values&mdash;i.e., the locations of the queens&mdash;in other data structures.)</p>
<p>The <code>isValid()</code> method in our template simply checks if <code>val</code> is a valid
value for the <code>n</code>th variable (in other words, does it fit the
constraints?). Depending on how you structure your solution, you may
not need to actually write a method for this.</p>
<p>Another detail of the template that can vary is the way that the
parameters to the method are modified in the recursive call. In the
template, <code>n</code> is incremented by 1 to indicate that the recursive call
will focus on the next variable. However, if you take the approach
that we have recommended in the problem (and illustrated in the
example), you will need to modify the parameters in some other way
when you make the recursive call. The important thing is that the new
parameters should reflect the subproblem that you&rsquo;re trying to solve
by making the recursive call, and the parameters should eventually
reach one of the values that constitute a base case of the recursion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m still struggling on the Lagrange problem. Do you have any
    additional suggestions?</strong></p>
<p>Here are four things that may help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you look the example that we&rsquo;ve given you in the problem
    set, you&rsquo;ll notice that a given call of <code>findSumRB()</code> is
    responsible for determining the value of just one of the terms
    of the sum. For example, <code>findSumRB(140,4)</code> is responsible for the
    first term in the sum (<code>terms[0]</code>), and <code>findSumRB(19,3)</code> is
    responsible for the second term in the sum (<code>terms[1]</code>). There is
    an easy piece of arithmetic that you can use to determine which
    term a given call of the method is responsible for, based on
    its parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In attempting to determine the value of a given term, you need
    to try the perfect squares that could work for that term, and
    we&rsquo;ve recommended that you start with the largest perfect
    square that would work. For example, say you are looking to
    break up 29 (i.e., <code>num</code> is 29). The sequence of squares that
    you would try is 25, 16, 9, 4, 1; i.e., those are the numbers
    you should loop over in that method frame. Because it may not
    be immediately clear how to set up a loop such that that
    sequence of squares is tried, you may want to consider looping
    over the roots of the squares instead of the squares
    themselves. In that case, the loop would iterate over: 5, 4,
    3, 2, 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may find it helpful to have more than one base-case test at
    the start of <code>findSumRB</code>: one to handle the case in which you
    have found a solution, and one to handle the case in which you
    have run out of terms and need to backtrack. (Note that this
    instance of backtracking is in addition to the backtracking
    that occurs once you have tried all possible values for a
    given term.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although you want the recursive call to have modified parameter
    values, you need to make sure that you don&rsquo;t modify the values
    of the parameters in the current stack frame. For example, in
    the nQueens example from lecture, we make a recursive call
    with a parameter of <code>row+1</code>. That gives the recursive call a
    parameter that is one more than the current call&rsquo;s parameter,
    but it does so in a way that doesn&rsquo;t change the value of <code>row</code>
    in the current stack frame. If we had instead done <code>row++</code> or
    <code>++row</code>, we would have modified the value of <code>row</code> in the current
    stack frame, and that would have caused problems when we
    returned to that frame during backtracking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m not really sure how to approach the final problem (&ldquo;making it
    smarter&rdquo;). Should I be looking out for specific numbers when the
    recursion reaches the 3rd term? Or is there some sort of more general
    formula that I can use?</strong></p>
<p>For the final problem, we&rsquo;re only looking for a simple enhancement
(e.g., a single <code>if</code> statement) that causes the backtracking to
happen sooner than it otherwise would in certain impossible
situations.</p>
<p>There are multiple approaches you could take that fit this
description. Obviously, your enhancement does <strong><em>not</em></strong> need to detect
<em>all</em> impossible situations, but it should ideally be a bit
more general than just looking out for specific numbers when you
reach the 3rd term.</p>
<p>Think about how you can use the information you have in a given
recursive invocation (the number of terms remaining, the amount of the
original number remaining, the perfect square you&rsquo;re considering
placing in the current position, etc.) to detect at least one class of
impossible situations...</p>
