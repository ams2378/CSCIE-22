<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>In problem 3 (tree traversal puzzles) can you recommend a
    systematic way of attacking the problem, or is trial-and-error the
    only viable approach?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned in lecture, there is certain information about the tree
that you can immediately glean by looking at the pairs of traversals
we give you. For example, what must be true of the <em>last</em> node
listed in a postorder traversal? The <em>first</em> node in a postorder
traversal? What can you say about the node listed just before the
root node in an inorder traversal? By asking such questions you
should be able to get at least a rough idea of what the tree looks
like, and you can then use trial-and-error to fill in the missing
pieces.</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t forget that whatever applies to the tree as a whole must
also apply recursively to any subtree of the tree. See if you can
use what you know about the traversals to determine the left and
right subtrees of the root, and then apply the same reasoning to
each subtree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Problem 3, part 1 seems to be incorrect. Shouldn&rsquo;t the inorder
    traversal have visited the keys in alphabetical order?</strong></p>
<p>The tree in this question isn&rsquo;t a binary search tree, so an inorder
traversal won&rsquo;t necessarily visit the nodes according to the values
of their keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For problem 4, part 1, do we need to show each step in the
    construction of the Huffman tree from the frequency data?</strong></p>
<p>No, you only need to show the <em>final</em> Huffman tree.</p>
<p>However, for problem 6, you <em>do</em> need to show each step
involved in inserting the keys into the trees, following the
guidelines specified in the problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In the Huffman tree that we specify for problem 4, part 1, do we need to
    include the frequencies in the nodes?</strong></p>
<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary to do so, although you may include
them if you prefer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For problem 8 (range search), we need to avoid
    &ldquo;visiting nodes unnecessarily.&rdquo; But it seems as though in many cases
    there&rsquo;s no way to avoid visiting nodes that fall outside the range.
    Can you give us a more precise definition of what constitutes
    &ldquo;unnecessarily&rdquo; visiting a node?</strong></p>
<p>You should avoid visiting nodes that <em>definitely</em> could not lead you
to nodes that are in range. That is, you should avoid visiting nodes
that are out of range themselves <em>and</em> none of whose descendants
could possibly be in range.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to traverse out-of-range nodes that
<em>could</em> lead you to in-range nodes. For example, consider the
following binary search tree:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>         8
        / \
       /   \
      6     9
     / \
    /   \
   4     7
  / \
 /   \
3     5
</pre></div>


<p>Assume that you&rsquo;re looking for nodes in the range 7-9. It&rsquo;s ok to
pass through the &lsquo;6&rsquo; node on the way to the &lsquo;7&rsquo; node, even though
the &lsquo;6&rsquo; node itself is out of range. However, it would <em>not</em> be ok
to visit the &lsquo;4&rsquo; node, since we know (due to the inherent properties
of binary search trees) that the subtree rooted at &lsquo;4&rsquo; could not
possibly contain any in-range nodes.</p>
<p>A good way to approach this problem is to base your code on the
single-key search code that is already in the <code>LinkedTree</code> class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In problem 9, I&rsquo;m having difficulty with part 1 of the
    suggested approach &ndash; initializing and maintaining the new <code>parent</code>
    fields in the <code>Node</code> objects. Do you have any suggestions?</strong></p>
<p>Try asking yourself few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When (in what method) does a <code>Node</code> first get a parent? In other
    words, when does a <code>Node</code> first become part of the tree? Add the
    appropriate code to set the value of the <code>parent</code> field in that
    method.</li>
<li>When (in what method) does a <code>Node</code>&lsquo;s parent change? Add the
    appropriate code to update the <code>parent</code> field in that method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the lines of code that you will write will just involve
setting a single field in the <code>Node</code> object. For example, if <code>n</code> is
the <code>Node</code> object, you will do something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">parent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">expression</span><span class="o">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>where <em>expression</em> is replaced with an appropriate expression for
the parent of <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>One caution: some of the existing <code>LinkedTree</code> methods actually use
a variable called <code>parent</code>. This variable is a local variable, and
it is <em>not</em> the same thing as the <code>parent</code> field in the <code>Node</code>
object. However, you may find that our use of this variable is
helpful when determining what changes you need to make to maintain
the <code>parent</code> fields!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In problem 9, I&rsquo;m having difficulty implementing the
    class for the postorder iterator. Can you give us any hints?</strong></p>
<p>You should start by studying the code for the <code>PreorderIterator</code>
inner class we&rsquo;ve given you, and reviewing the analysis of
that code that we performed in section. You should use the
<code>PreorderIterator</code> class as a template for the overall structure of
your postorder iterator class.</p>
<p>The constructor for your postorder
iterator will be more complicated than the constructor for the
preorder iterator, since an postorder traversal doesn&rsquo;t necessarily
begin with the root of the tree. You&rsquo;ll need to iteratively navigate
to the appropriate first node for a postorder traversal, and
initialize your instance variable(s) so that that node&rsquo;s key will be
returned by the first call to <code>next()</code>.</p>
<p>Your <code>next()</code> method itself should have the same basic structure as
the <code>next()</code> method in the preorder iterator class. However, the
cases you&rsquo;ll need to consider in your <code>if</code> statement may be
different. For a preorder traversal, we determined that there were 3
cases to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>the current node has a left child (in which case the next node
    to visit is the left child)</li>
<li>the current node has no left child, but has a right child (in
    which case the next node to visit is the right child)</li>
<li>the current node is a leaf node (in which case we need to back
    up the tree and find a node with a right child not on the path
    to the current node)</li>
</ol>
<p>When trying to determine what cases need to be dealt with in the
<em>postorder</em> version of <code>next()</code>, it might help to trace through a
postorder traversal of some example binary trees on paper. At each
node in the traversal, ask yourself what operations need to be
performed to get to the next node in the traversal. You should soon
find that these operations fall into a relatively small number of
categories. These will become the branches of the if statement you
write for the <code>next()</code> method.</p>
<p>If you find that you have a large number of cases, or your class is
substantially longer than the <code>PreorderIterator</code> class, you&rsquo;re
probably on the wrong track.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For problem 9, does our <code>next()</code> method need to have a
    time complexity of O(1)?</strong></p>
<p>No. It will sometimes be necessary to follow one or more parent
links back up the tree in your <code>next()</code> method, something that can&rsquo;t
be done in O(1) time since it depends on the height of the tree.
However, your <code>next()</code> method should be as time-efficient as you can
make it, and your iterator class as a whole should have a <em>space</em>
complexity of O(1). And as the problem states, your <code>hasNext()</code>
method <em>does</em> need to run in O(1) time. Efficiency will be a
non-trivial part of your grade for this problem.</p>
